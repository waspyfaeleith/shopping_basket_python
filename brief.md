Coding Challenge - Shopping Basket Task

Purpose
The coding challenge will give us an idea of your skills and approach to programming. We would like you to write some code as specified at point A below. We will also ask you to do some pair programming as part of the review of your code as listed at point B. For the paired programming exercise, please treat the instructor as if they were a student and explain the concepts in a manner appropriate to a beginner.



A. You need to model a shopping basket.  We must be able to:
add items to the shopping basket
remove items from the shopping basket
empty the shopping basket
calculate the total of the shopping basket

There is no requirement to create a GUI but we must be able to see the code running or tests passing.


B. For the second half of the code test we'd like you to come in, pair up with one of us and attempt the following:-
Buy-one-get-one-free discounts on items
10% off on totals greater than £20 (after bogof)
2% off on total (after all other discounts) for customers with loyalty cards.


What we will be looking for:
Evidence of using one of the following OO programming languages – Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Python, C# or Swift - and solid coding techniques with evidence of test driven development.


Time
You are given a few days to complete this task. Once finished, you can email it back to us or put it on your github account and send us a link.
